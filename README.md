# Tux Racer 1.1 on Modern Linux

This repo contains a revised installer + a custom SDL 1.2 compatibility layer for running Tux Racer 1.1 on Linux. It normally doesn't run due to an unknown error with SDL 1.2's official compatibility layer (though it may be due to the same issue with 32-bit Mesa that this project has to work around). The end goal is also to take advantage of any newer features of Linux (i.e. WM-specific Wayland protocols) to enhance the game.
